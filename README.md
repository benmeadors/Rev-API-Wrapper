# Rev.com API Wrapper

This is another on-going project. I’m working on an integration between Iconik.io and Rev.com, a transcription service. This is an API wrapper for Rev.com’s API, to upload a file to Rev’s server, create and submit a transcription order for that file, and and get order info after the fact.
